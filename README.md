# dotfiles
This is my personal `dotfiles` project for MacOs &amp; Ubuntu Linux.
I was tired of always setting up of new environment, so I decided to make it automated everytime new machine comes up.
I know there are lots of such projects, but I wanted to make my own to improve & learn more shell/bash scripting skills. :-)
